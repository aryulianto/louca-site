# LOUCA23 is Coming!

Hello World! With this post, we are pleased to announce that this year we will be holding LibreOffice Conf. Asia and UbuCon Asia 2023 in Indonesia! Let's agree to call this activity shorter and catchier 'LOUCA23'.

For now, what we can convey is information that this activity will be held simultaneously and collaboratively at the same venue around the end of September or early October. Currently we are in the process of establishing several communications with several prospective venues, updates regarding dates and locations will be announced as soon as the committee gets an official decision from the prospective venues.

To get the latest information about LOUCA23, please follow some of the social media channels that we have provided.
