### A. Flights to Indonesia

To begin with, if you are not from Indonesia, there are at least three international airports from which to enter the country.

- Juanda Airport / SUB (Surabaya, East Java)
- I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport / DPS (Denpasar Bali)

Here are several routes to these three airports that you might make reference to.

### B. Towards Surakarta

After arriving at one of the airports listed above, you have two alternatives for getting to the city of Surakarta. The first choice is to travel by plane, and the second is to take the train.

If you prefer to travel by plane, please book a flight to Adi Soemarmo International Airport. This is without a doubt the quickest way to arrive in Surakarta.

However, if you are not in a hurry, you can take the train. This train option is only available if you arrive at Soekarno-Hatta Airport (CGK) or Juanda Surabaya Airport (SUB).

#### Train Station Options from CGK

There are two train station options from Jakarta to Surakarta: Gambir Station (recommended) and Pasar Senen Station.

To go to one of these stations, take the Airport Train to Gambir Station. The most convenient way to go to Gambir Station or Pasar Senen after arriving is to take a station taxi or book online transportation. Your destination station should be Jebres Solo.

#### Train Station Options from SUB

There are two train station options from Surabaya to Surakarta: Gubeng Station and Pasar Turi Station. To go to one of these stations, you can take a taxi or order transportation online. Your destination station should be Balapan Solo.


### C. Welcome to Surakarta

You have arrived in Surakarta. It's been a long road. If you followed the instructions we provided above, you should have arrived at the airport, Jebres station, and Balapan station by now. Then, how do I get to the LOUCA23 venue?

The most convenient way to get to the Venue is by taking an airport / station taxi or ordering transportation online.  Tell the driver the following address:

```
